            <h2>Just <em>Lean</em> Into it</h2>
            <h5>September 16, 2023</h5>
            <p>I have a Raspberry Pi which I use for retro gaming and web servers. If you don't know what an Raspberry Pi is, it's a credit card-sized computer that's used for hobby projects. I've been wanting to make a casing/shell for it because I like customizing my things. I came up with a bunch of styles such as a flat slab and a spherical design, but I eventually settled on a hilarious pun: the Leaning Tower of Pi-sa. Get it? Pisa but with a Raspberry Pi? *laughs in html/css* Well, I thought it was funny. The case would look like a PC tower, but leaning backwards, hence the name. Below is the original design (and yes I made a blueprint).</p>

            <p>I got to work the next day, following my design's specifications to the approximate tee. This was my first time making something out of wood, so it was a little sloppy. I had these boards left over from a kitchen, so I used those. The case needed a cooling system, so I gutted a cooling pad and used the fans to expel air from the case. This causes new air to come into the case, thus cooling the whole thing. I was not too proud of the I/O, but it's a prototype. After all, da Vinci didn't paint the Mona Lisa without doodling as a kid. Here's the finished design:</p>

            <p>So it's been over a year since the previous paragraph was written. I'm finally getting around to finishing this blog post hehe. Anyways, after enjoying the novelty of this fun wooden design, I thought, "Huh. What if I made this out of plastic?" So I started thinking. Thinking some more. And I thunk! I opened up a fun website called TinkerCAD (very nice for beginners and simple designs) and designed a fun little case incorporating some actual I/O (who woulda knew?) and two MUCH smaller case fans (who woulda known?).</p>

            <p>I started wondering, how the hell am I gonna print this design? I don't have a 3D printer. But luck struck with possible the greatest timing. My neighbor, Randy, has a 3D printer. Hell, he invents stuff for a living! He wanted to help me out, so I sent him my design, and after a bit of back and forth with revisions, he printed the case in a black PLA filament.</p>

            <img src="6.jpg" alt="i love the button" />
            <p>What a beaut! This thing looks AMAZING! I had to sand down some of the I/O to get it to fit correctly and I rigged the fans into place with old wood and hot glue. Also, yes, that is a button hanging out the back, and yes, it is a power button. No I will not be securing it to anything. It's fine just the way it is!</p>
            <p>I suppose I have to write some closing statement or something here. Thanks Randy! You're a pretty nice dude. TinkerCAD is a very nice website. Also 3D printers are really frickin expensive so I don't think I'll have one anytime soon. Anyways, peace out and stay <span class="funky-text">funky</span></p>

            <p>I love Futurama! It's one of the wittiest cartoons I have ever seen and Zoidberg is possibly the funniest cartoon character to ever exist. I've watched it about 7 times over and I WILL nerd out about it constantly.</p>
            <p>I like to think my music taste is quite nice, although others may disagree. I listen to a lot of old-school rap and hip-hop, from the likes of Eminem, Dr. Dre, Biggie, Beastie Boys, and Run-DMC (just to name a few). I also write some stuff myself, but I haven't yet produced an actual song.</p>
            <p>I LOVE LOVE LOVE computers and technology. My brain is very logic-oriented, so it's very easy for me to understand how things work with machines and code. I've made a few fun projects such as this website (self-referential :D), a handheld console that plays Pong, and a multimeter. More about these things can be found on my blog (if I get around to it lol)</p>
            <p>Video games are a big part of my life. I absolutely adore retro games for their simplicity and the pure enjoyment I get from them. I also like car-racing games, Deep Rock Galactic, Minecraft, and Team Fortress 2. I'm a big fan of Valve and Steam and what they've done with gaming. I have a Steam Deck, a GBA SP, and an SNES, in addition to my PC.</p>
